# -EDA-How-people-spend-their-time
Purpose of the dataset  How people spend their time is similar in many ways across countries: we all sleep, work, eat and enjoy leisure.
But there are also important differences in the freedom people have to spend time on the things they value most.
Studying how people across the world spend their time provides an important perspective for understanding living conditions, economic opportunities, and
general well-being.
